# Muxy Extension Guide

A Muxy extension is an npm + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project: source under `src/`, an entry HTML that `vite build` emits into `dist/`, and Muxy reads `dist/` when present (otherwise the project folder). The manifest is the `"muxy"` object in `package.json`. There is no fixed folder layout — every `entry`/`background`/icon path is an arbitrary relative path inside the build output (the vanilla starter kit emits its panel to `panel/index.html`); `package.json` and `dist/` are the only names Muxy fixes. During development you don't copy into the config folder — **Load Unpacked** in the Extensions modal points Muxy at any folder (your git checkout *is* the install).

**The `build` script must copy `package.json` into `dist/`.** The publish pipeline ships **only** `dist/`, and the app reads the manifest from the install root — so the manifest has to be inside the build output. `vite build` alone emits your entry/asset paths but **not** the manifest, so use `"build": "vite build && node scripts/copy-manifest.mjs"` where `copy-manifest.mjs` copies `package.json` into `dist/`. Easy to miss because **Load Unpacked** falls back to the root `package.json` in dev, so it loads locally but fails validation/install when published. The vanilla starter kit already wires this up.

**This skill is the guidance layer — how an extension should look and behave.** For the API and manifest mechanics (every field, the permission strings, the full `window.muxy` surface, events, scripts), read the reference docs. Start from the LLM-friendly index, which lists every page and links to its raw Markdown source:

> **<https://muxy.app/llms.txt>**

Append `/plain` to any docs URL for the raw Markdown of that page (e.g. <https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/manifest/plain>).

The goal of everything below: an extension should be indistinguishable from a native Muxy surface. Match the theme and match the scale, and it will be.

## Pick the right surface

- **Showing something to the user** → a **UI page** (tab, panel, or popover). Page scripts get the full `window.muxy` API.
- **A persistent, full-height navigation or control surface that replaces the built-in left sidebar** → a **`sidebar`** (one per extension; the user selects it in Settings → Sidebar). It fills the entire region — the project list *and* the footer — so own your own navigation. Same `window.muxy` API and theme variables as a panel.
- **Reacting durably to events, coordinating multiple webviews, or running shell commands headlessly** → a **`background.js`** script. It can also call `muxy.tabs.open` to show a result in the active workspace. Most extensions don't need one.
- **One-shot logic from the palette** → a **`runScript`** command, not a hidden tab. Its `muxy.*` calls are **synchronous** except for the Promise-based `muxy.execAsync`. It has `tabs`/`panes`/`projects`/`worktrees`/`browser`/`agents`/`files`/`git`/`exec`/`execAsync`/`dialog`/`modal`/`topbar`/`statusbar`/`notifications`, but **not** `http`, `events`, `remote`, `panels`, or `popover`. It can open a modal and act on the choice inline — no page or background listener needed.
- **Your own HTML in a modal on a keypress** (a form, info, a list, or mixed — not just forms) → a **webview modal** (`muxy.modal.openWebview`). A centered omnibox-style overlay rendering your HTML. Reach for it over the native `muxy.modal.open` picker when a list won't express what you need. **Prefer opening it from `background.js`** — it's always running, so a shortcut works with nothing else on screen, and you can pass dynamic `data` and `await` the result. Use the declarative `openModal` command action only for a static, self-contained modal that needs no result and no `background.js`. The modal returns a value via `muxy.modal.submitWebview(value)` only if the opener wants one; an informational modal just calls `muxy.lifecycle.close()`.

Don't open a hidden tab to run logic, and don't put durable event-driven work in tab JS where closing the tab loses it. Use `muxy.events.emit('extension.<name>', payload)` plus a background listener when a webview needs to ask background.js for shared or long-lived work.

## Theme — follow it, never hardcode

Muxy ships paired light/dark themes and a user-chosen accent. Every extension webview inherits CSS custom properties on `document.documentElement` that track the live theme and update automatically when the user switches it.

**Rules:**

1. **No hex literals for chrome.** Use `var(--muxy-…)` for every color. The only exception is decorative art meant to be theme-independent.
2. **The variables already invert** for light/dark — never sniff the color scheme to pick a color. Only branch on `muxy.theme.colorScheme` for things a variable can't express (e.g. swapping a logo image).
3. **`--muxy-accent` is the only saturated color.** Use it sparingly — primary action, focus ring, one key number — so it stays distinctive. Text *on* an accent fill should be `--muxy-background` to stay legible in both themes.
4. **Depth comes from `--muxy-surface` + `--muxy-border` + `--muxy-hover`,** not from new colors. Cards, inputs, code blocks, and buttons all share the one surface color.
5. **Re-read the theme for JS-drawn color.** Canvas/SVG that doesn't pick up CSS variables must redraw in `muxy.onThemeChange(theme => …)`.
6. **Popovers leave the body transparent** (`body { background: transparent; }`) — they sit over native macOS popover material that is already light/dark-aware. Tabs and panels *do* paint `--muxy-background` on the body.

**The variables (the complete injected set):**

| Variable | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `--muxy-background` | Page background |
| `--muxy-foreground` | Primary text |
| `--muxy-foreground-muted` | Secondary text, labels, captions |
| `--muxy-surface` | Cards, inputs, code blocks, buttons |
| `--muxy-border` | 1px borders and dividers |
| `--muxy-hover` | Hover state for buttons / rows |
| `--muxy-accent` | Primary action, links, focus rings |
| `--muxy-accent-soft` | Translucent accent for badges/highlights |
| `--muxy-diff-add` / `--muxy-diff-remove` / `--muxy-diff-hunk` | Diff / success / error / hunk colors |
| `--muxy-topbar-height` | The app's tab-bar height (see Sizing) |

(`muxy.theme.colorScheme` gives `"light"`/`"dark"` in JS; there is no `--muxy-color-scheme` CSS var.)

## Sizing — match the app's scale

Muxy's native views are built from one scale of values, and **all of them scale with the user's interface-scale setting** (Settings → Interface). Pick from this scale rather than inventing numbers, so your surface tracks scale changes the way native views do. These are the base (100%) values in px:

**Spacing** (padding, `gap`, margin) — `2 · 4 · 6 · 8 · 10 · 12 · 16 · 20 · 24 · 32`. No in-between values. Panel rows and content pad `10px` left/right; an icon-and-label gap is `8px`; adjacent icon buttons sit `4px` apart.

**Font sizes** — `10` caption · `11` footnote/section labels (often uppercased) · **`12` body** (paths, row text) · `13` controls · **`14` titles** (weight 600) · `16`+ headings. Body is `12`, not `13`. Use the system font for UI; `"SF Mono", Menlo, monospace` for code, counts, and hashes.

**Icons** — `12`–`14px` glyphs at **weight 600** (a thinner default weight is the most common reason an extension's icons look foreign). Custom SVG strokes are `1.5px`, round caps/joins.

**Controls** — an icon button is a **`24×24` hit target** wrapping a `13`–`14px` glyph; text buttons are `28px` tall with `10px` horizontal padding.

**Radii** — `4` chips/badges · `6` buttons/inputs · `8` cards/panels · `10` large containers. Buttons are `4`–`6`, not `5`.

**Topbar height is the exception — never hardcode it.** It scales with interface scale and is injected pre-scaled as `--muxy-topbar-height`. A tab fills its whole pane, so render your own topbar to match native surfaces (so sibling panes line up): use that variable for the height and keep `box-sizing: content-box` so the 1px `border-bottom` lands on the same line as native tabs. Split-child tabs appear as bordered panes inside their owner and do not have a local tab strip. Omit the topbar for edge-to-edge content.

Declare the scale once at the top of your stylesheet and reference it everywhere, so there are no stray magic numbers:

```css
:root {
  --s1:2px; --s2:4px; --s3:6px; --s4:8px; --s5:10px;
  --s6:12px; --s7:16px; --s8:20px; --s9:24px; --s10:32px;
  --font-caption:10px; --font-footnote:11px; --font-body:12px;
  --font-emphasis:13px; --font-title:14px;
  --icon-sm:12px; --icon:14px; --control:24px;
  --radius:6px; --radius-card:8px; --row-height:34px;
}
```

## Behavior

- **Least privilege.** Declare a permission only when you add the call that needs it.
- **Workspaces can be remote.** When the active workspace is a remote (SSH) workspace, `muxy.exec`, `muxy.execAsync`, `muxy.git.*`, and worktree work run **on the remote server** with the selected SSH device's environment, and paths are remote paths. Write extensions against the active workspace, not a hardcoded local machine — the same code works for local and remote because Muxy brokers the SSH connection. See [Scripts](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/scripts).
- **Use `muxy.execAsync` for cancellable long-running runScript commands** — it returns `{ id, result, cancel() }`; `result` resolves to the same shape as `muxy.exec`, and cancellation rejects with `error.code === "cancelled"` / `error.cancelled === true`. Local cancellation terminates the command process group; remote cancellation closes the SSH command channel, so detached remote processes may outlive the job. Keep `muxy.exec` for short synchronous calls. An extension may run at most 32 commands concurrently across both APIs — beyond that, starting a command fails. See [Scripts](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/scripts).
- **Use `muxy.git` for repository work** (status, diff incl. `{ raw: true }`, repoInfo, log, branches, PRs incl. `pr.number`/`pr.diff`, tags, init, checkout/cherryPick/revert, branch `delete`/`deleteRemote`, worktrees incl. `worktree.switchTo` and `pr.checkoutWorktree`) instead of shelling out via `muxy.exec` — it's the app's own git core, returns structured data, and caches reads. Reads need `git:read`; writes need `git:write` and prompt for consent. Reads are cached per project/worktree (HEAD/index aware); pass `{ fresh: true }` to bypass. Available to tabs, panels, popovers, `runScript` commands, and background scripts. See [Git](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/git).
- **Get the signed-in GitHub user with `muxy.gh.user()`** instead of shelling out to `gh api user` — it returns `{ login, name, avatarUrl }` from the local `gh` CLI login, needs `gh:read`, and caches for five minutes so a header/badge can call it on every render. The account is global to the `gh` login, so no `{ project }` argument; it always reflects the local login, even on a remote (SSH) workspace. See [GitHub](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/gh).
- **Manage the project list with `muxy.projects` write verbs** instead of editing `projects.json` — `add(path)` registers an existing folder as a project, makes it the active project, and returns its project id, `rename(identifier, name)`, `setColor`/`setIcon(identifier, value)`, `setLogo(identifier, storedLogoFilename)` (pass `null` to clear), and `reorder(identifiers)` (all local non-home project ids in the new order, each exactly once). All need `projects:write` and mutate Muxy's live project store, so the native sidebar updates immediately. `add` only accepts an existing directory; create the folder first via `muxy.files`/`muxy.exec` if needed. Subscribe to the `projects.changed` event (declare `events: ["projects.changed"]`, grant `projects:read`) to notify a webview/sidebar that can refetch via `muxy.projects.list()` after any change, whether made by your extension or Muxy itself. The home project cannot be renamed, recolored, re-iconed, or reordered. See [Permissions](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/permissions).
- **`muxy.projects.delete(identifier)` deletes a project** and is irreversible — it cleans up the project's worktrees, branches, and directories on disk. It needs the `projects:delete` permission (separate from `projects:write`) and prompts the user for confirmation on every call. The home project cannot be deleted. Reserve it for explicit user-driven actions, never silent cleanup. See [Permissions](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/permissions).
- **Use `muxy.files` for workspace filesystem work** (list, read, stat, write, mkdir, rename, move, delete) instead of `muxy.exec` — paths are sandboxed to the active worktree root and returned relative to it. Reads need `files:read`; writes need `files:write` and prompt for consent. Pair with the `file.changed` event to stay reactive (e.g. a file tree). See [Files](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/files).
- **Persist your own state with `muxy.storage`** instead of shelling out to a config file — `set(key, value)` / `get(key)` (any JSON value; `get` returns `null` when absent) / `delete(key)` / `keys()`. Storage is isolated per extension and shared across that extension's surfaces (a panel and its `background.js` see the same keys), and survives restarts. Needs `storage:read` (`get`/`keys`) / `storage:write` (`set`/`delete`); a key is ≤256 chars, a value ≤1 MB. Good for layout/collapse/preferences. See [Storage](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/storage).
- **Ask for a value or a folder with `muxy.dialog.prompt` / `muxy.dialog.pickFolder`** instead of `osascript` — `prompt({ title, message, default?, placeholder?, confirm?, cancel? })` resolves the entered string (or `null`), `pickFolder({ title?, message?, default? })` resolves an absolute path (or `null`). Same surfaces and no-permission rule as `confirm`/`alert`. See [Dialogs](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/dialogs).
- **React to branch changes with the `worktree.headChanged` event** instead of polling `git.worktrees()` — it fires when a worktree's checked-out branch changes (e.g. a `git checkout` in a terminal), with the new `branch` and worktree `path`. Declare `events: ["worktree.headChanged"]` and grant `worktrees:read`. See [Events](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/events).
- **React to AI agent activity with the `agent.status` event** instead of polling — it reports an agent's lifecycle per worktree (`working` > `waiting` > `idle`, with `providerID` and the owning `paneID`), driven by the provider's hooks (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Droid, Grok, OpenCode, Pi). `idle` covers a finished, cancelled, or ended turn; Muxy's native finished indicator is separate UI state. Coverage depends on what each CLI's hooks expose — Pi and Cursor do not report `waiting`; the other providers report all three states. It fires only when a worktree's status changes and turns `idle` when the last agent pane closes. Declare `events: ["agent.status"]` and grant `agents:read` (both the event subscription and `muxy.agents.list()` need it); pair the event with `muxy.agents.list()` to hydrate current statuses on load. Good for a live per-worktree indicator. See [Events](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/events).
- **Use `muxy.http.fetch` to call external APIs from a tab/panel/popover** instead of the webview's `fetch()` — the request goes out via native code, so it is **not CORS-blocked**, and a panel needs no `background.js` (no subprocess) just to reach the network. Pass `(url, { method?, headers?, body?, timeoutMs? })` and `await` `{ status, headers, body, truncated }`. No manifest permission; the first call to a host prompts for consent, "Allow & remember" whitelists that host. Private/loopback hosts (localhost, `127.*`, `192.168.*`, `169.254.*`, `.local`, …) are blocked. `muxy.http` is a webview-only surface — neither background scripts nor `runScript` commands have `fetch`; they shell out via `muxy.exec(['curl', …])`. See [HTTP](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/http).
- **Use `muxy.modal.open` for a list picker** (the native searchable picker overlay) instead of building your own — pass `{ items: [{ id, title, subtitle? }], placeholder?, onSelect(choice) }`; the choice (or `null` if dismissed) arrives in `onSelect`. Muxy owns the search, navigation, and open/close. No permission needed. Available on every surface: on `runScript`/background `modal.open` returns immediately and you read the result in `onSelect`; on webview pages you can also `await` it. It has no shortcut of its own: bind a palette `command` with a `defaultShortcut` (its action can be the `runScript` that opens the modal, or an `event` a `background.js` listener reacts to). Pass `searchToolbar: true` only when the picker should show the footer search option toggles (`Aa`, `W`, `.*`). **For large lists (a file picker over a big repo), pass `items` as a function `items(emit)` instead of an array** — the picker opens instantly and you stream rows with `emit(batch)` while Muxy filters them natively, so typing never calls back into your code and the UI can't hang. **For results that depend on the query (server-side/async search), pass `onQuery(query, emit)`** — Muxy debounces the field and calls it per query so you supply a fresh list, dropping responses for superseded queries; native filtering still runs on top. See [Modal](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/modal).
- **Bind keyboard shortcuts to your extension** — for a *static* binding declare a palette `command` with a `defaultShortcut` (`"cmd+shift+e"`); for a *runtime* one (e.g. configurable in your settings) call `muxy.shortcuts.register({ id, combo })` from `background.js` and subscribe to the same `command.<id>` event. `register` returns `{ ok, conflict? }`; `unregister(id)` and `list()` round it out. Runtime shortcuts need `shortcuts:register`, are not persisted (re-register on launch), and reject an `id` that collides with a manifest command. See [Palette Commands](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/palette-commands).
- **Build your own session restore from `background.js`** — Muxy has no built-in session restore, so an extension owns it. Record sessions by subscribing to the enriched `tab.*` events (which now carry `kind`/`projectID`/`worktreeID`/`areaID`/`cwd`/`data`), then recreate each terminal with `muxy.tabs.open({ kind: 'terminal', directory, command })`, which resolves the new tab's id (for `extensionWebView` tabs, the instance id usable with `setTitle`/`setIcon`). `directory` stays inside the worktree root; `command` adds a one-time runtime consent on top of `tabs:write`. See [Events](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/events) and [Tabs](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/tabs).
- **Use `extension.*` events for webview ↔ background communication** — pages and background scripts can `muxy.events.subscribe('extension.<name>', handler)` and `muxy.events.emit('extension.<name>', payload)`. These events are same-extension only, need no permission, and are not listed in the manifest `events` array. A webview emit is relayed through the extension's `background.js`, so it rejects when no background script is running — webviews can't reach each other directly. Workspace events (`pane.*`, `file.changed`, etc.) still require manifest `events`.
- **Update bar items live with `muxy.topbar.set` / `muxy.statusbar.set`** — pass `{ id, icon?, visible? }` (topbar) or `{ id, icon?, text?, visible? }` (statusbar) from `background.js` or any page to swap the icon/text or show/hide without reloading; `text: null` clears back to the manifest value. Decide visibility at runtime: declare the item with `"visible": false` and call `muxy.topbar.show(id)` / `.hide(id)` (or `muxy.statusbar.show(id)` / `.hide(id)`) when it applies. The item must be declared in `topbarItems` / `statusBarItems`; needs `panels:write`. Good for live indicators (e.g. a PR badge that only appears inside a repo). See [Topbar](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/topbar) / [Status bar](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/statusbar).
- **Retitle a tab live with `muxy.tabs.setTitle(title)` / `muxy.tabs.setIcon(icon)`** from the tab's own page to reflect changing state (e.g. an editor showing the open file). `icon` is `"<sf-symbol>"`, `{ symbol }`, or `{ svg }`; `setTitle("")` / `setIcon(null)` reset to the manifest defaults. Needs `tabs:write`; runtime-only (resets on restart, so set it again on load). See [Tabs](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/tabs).
- **Autofocus your input on `muxy.onFocus`** from a tab/panel/popover page so the surface behaves like a native one — when its tab is opened or switched back to, move keyboard focus into your editor or search field. The callback receives `true` on focus gained, `false` on lost; `muxy.focused` reads the current state. No permission, no manifest field. See [Tabs](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/tabs).
- **Register project file handlers with `fileOpeners`.** Users choose extension-provided openers only in Settings; they never appear in the topbar project-target control. If an opener becomes unavailable, Muxy preserves the selection and resumes using it when the extension is available again. The referenced tab receives `source: "terminal"`, the project-relative `filePath`, and optional `line`/`column` through `muxy.data` or `muxy.onDataChange` when its singleton tab is reused. See [Tabs](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/tabs#file-openers).
- **Guard a close with `muxy.lifecycle.onBeforeClose(handler)`** from a tab/panel/popover page when closing could lose work (a dirty editor). Return/resolve `true` (or `{ prevent: true }`) to prevent the close, anything else to allow it; the handler may be `async`, so `await muxy.dialog.confirm(...)` and decide. Closing a top-level tab asks its own and every split-child surface in parallel; any veto cancels the entire hierarchy close. Call `muxy.lifecycle.close()` to finish the close yourself without re-asking. No permission, no manifest field — registering the handler is the opt-in, and it fails open (no handler / timeout / throw ⇒ closes). It does **not** fire on app quit or an outside-click popover dismiss; for those, persist reactively instead. To merely react after a close, subscribe to `tab.closed` / `panel.closed` / `popover.closed`. See [Lifecycle](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/lifecycle).
- **Drive and automate the built-in browser with `muxy.browser.*`.** Tabs: `open(url, { split })` returns the tab ID; `navigate(tabId, url)`, `reload/back/forward(tabId)`, `list()`, `read(tabId)` (`{ title, url, text }`, ~1 MB cap), `close(tabId)`. Automation: `eval(tabId, script)` (returns the parsed JS result), `click`, `type(…, { submit })`, `fill`, `press(tabId, key, selector?)`, `select`, `hover`, `scrollIntoView`, `setChecked`. Waiting: `wait(tabId, { selector|text|urlContains|function, timeoutMs })`, `waitFor`, `waitForNavigation`. Inspection: `getText/getHTML/getValue/getAttribute/getCount`, `is(tabId, property, selector)`, `find(tabId, kind, value)`, `snapshot(tabId, selector?)` (visible interactive elements — let an agent "see" the page), `screenshot(tabId)` (base64 PNG). State: `storage.get/set/clear(tabId, key, value?, kind)` for local/session storage; `cookies.get/set/delete/clear(tabId, ...)` per profile. Reads and JS-running calls (`eval`, `click`, `type`, `waitFor`, `get*`, `screenshot`, `storage.*`) need `browser:read`/`browser:write`; `navigate`, `cookies`, `list` do not. All of them work headlessly on any open tab in the active project — the tab need not be visible or focused (`screenshot` renders off-screen). Every call fails when the user disables the built-in browser. Capture the tab ID from `open`/`list` and reuse it. See [Browser](https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/browser).
- **Make hover and active states visible** in both light and dark — `background: var(--muxy-hover); border-color: var(--muxy-accent);` is the standard pattern.
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** — Muxy users opt into Reduce Motion at the OS level; avoid long transitions, large translations, autoplay.
- **No hardcoded `~/.config/muxy` paths** from inside the extension — rely on the working directory Muxy sets, or pass `cwd` to `exec`.

## Checklist

- [ ] Every color is `var(--muxy-…)`; `muxy.onThemeChange` wired for any JS-drawn color.
- [ ] Spacing, font, icon, control, and radius values come from the scale above — no off-ramp numbers (rows pad `10px`, body is `12px`, icons `12`–`14px` at weight 600).
- [ ] Tab topbar uses `--muxy-topbar-height` with `box-sizing: content-box`.
- [ ] Hover/active states are visible in both themes.
- [ ] `permissions` declares only what is used.
- [ ] Durable event-driven work is in `background.js`, not tab JS. Webview coordination uses `extension.*` events. No background script unless events, shared state, or background `exec` are needed.
- [ ] `build` copies `package.json` into `dist/` (e.g. `vite build && node scripts/copy-manifest.mjs`) — only `dist/` ships, so the manifest must be inside it.
- [ ] Built with `npm run build`, then **Reload** in the Extensions modal (a Reload alone won't pick up unbuilt source).
